<h4> When Stoping in Madison, the first place I wanted to go was the Olbrich Botanical Gardens, but before I arrived, I had to make sure I had everything on my list that I would need for the trip.</h4>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Camera</li>
    <li>Notebook</li>
    <li>Hiking Shoes</li>
    <li>Tourist Brochure</li>
    <li>Bag</li>
<h4>I walked around, looked at all the plants and took pictures of them with my camera. "IMAGE" Then I took a pit stop to look at the State capital building to tour it and get a drink from the bubbler, or drinking fountain. Then I walked around downtown Madison to take a look at all of the shops. I was sad that I coulden't get to all of the places on my list here.</h4>

<h4>I stoped in Portage Wisconisn to visit the WWII history museum that they have."IMAGE" Then when looking at a Portage tourist brochure, I saw that the Fort Winnebago Surgeons Quarters Historic Site would be a great place to stop. "IMAGE" When walking through Portage I made a friend because I accidentally bumped into someone and said, "Ope, sorry" because I was trying to walk past them and we both laughed.</h4>
<h1 style="color:aliceblue;font-family:calibri">Baraboo</h1>
<h2 style="color:darksalmon;font-family:cursive"> June 13, 2022</h2>
<h4> When arriving in Baraboo, I didn't realize how many stop n' go lights, or traffic lights, there were. I was so thankful once I reached Devil's Lake State Park because it was a break from all of the driving. "IMAGE" I took my note book out of my bag and wrote down everything that happened so far today. After that I took my hiking shoes and when on differen hiking trails all day. Like the Balanced Rock Trail, Pewit's Nest Gorg and the Baraboo Riverwalk </h3>
