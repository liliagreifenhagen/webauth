<h4><strong>I walked around, looked at all the plants and took pictures of them with my camera.

Then I walked around downtown Madison to take a look at all of the shops. I was sad that I coulden't get to all of the places on my list here.</strong></h4>

<h1 id="A2" style="color:aliceblue;font-family:calibri"><b>Portage Wisconsin</b></h1>
<h2 style="color:darksalmon;font-family:cursive"><em> June 12, 2022</em></h2>
<h4><strong>I stoped in Portage Wisconisn to visit the WWII history museum that they have."IMAGE" Then when looking at a Portage tourist brochure, I saw that the Fort Winnebago Surgeons Quarters Historic Site would be a great place to stop. "IMAGE" When walking through Portage I made a friend because I accidentally bumped into someone and said, "Ope, sorry" because I was trying to walk past them and we both laughed.</strong></h4>

<h1 id="A3" style="color:aliceblue;font-family:calibri"><b>Baraboo</b></h1>
<h2 style="color:darksalmon;font-family:cursive"><em> June 13, 2022</em></h2>
<h4><strong> When arriving in Baraboo, I didn't realize how many stop n' go lights, or traffic lights, there were. I was so thankful once I reached Devil's Lake State Park because it was a break from all of the driving. "IMAGE" I took my note book out of my bag and wrote down everything that happened so far today. After that I took my hiking shoes and when on differen hiking trails all day. Like the Balanced Rock Trail, Pewit's Nest Gorg and the Baraboo Riverwalk.</strong> </h3>
