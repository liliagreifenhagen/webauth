<h4><strong>I walked around, looked at all the plants &amp; took pictures of them with my camera. Then I took a pit stop to look at the State capital building to tour it &amp; get a drink from the bubbler, or drinking fountain. Then I walked around downtown Madison to take a look at all of the shops. I was sad that I coulden't get to all of the places on my list here.</strong></h4>

<h2 style="color:darksalmon;font-family:cursive"><em> June 12, 2022</em></h2>
<h4><strong>I stoped in Portage Wisconisn to visit the WWII history museum that they have.<!--Image--> <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/38/27/71/portage-wwii-history.jpg?w=500&h=-1&s=1" alt="Portage WWII History Museum" style="float:right;width:350px;height:245;" > Then when looking at a Portage tourist brochure, I saw that the Fort Winnebago Surgeons Quarters Historic Site would be a great place to stop. <!--IMAGE--><img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/32/47/dd/surgeon-s-quarters-on.jpg?w=500&h=-1&s=1" alt="Surgeons Quarters" style="float:right;width:200px;height:135px;" >When walking through Portage I made a friend because I accidentally bumped into someone &amp; said, "Ope, sorry" because I was trying to walk past them &amp; we both laughed.</strong></h4>

<h1 id="A3" style="color:aliceblue;font-family:calibri"><b>Baraboo</b></h1>
<h2 style="color:darksalmon;font-family:cursive"><em> June 13, 2022</em></h2>
<h4><strong> <!--IMAGE--> <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/6e/7a/b9/devil-s-lake-state-park.jpg?w=500&h=-1&s=1" alt="Devil's Lake State Park" style="float:right;width:10;height:3;">When arriving in Baraboo, I didn't realize how many stop n' go lights, or traffic lights, there were. I was so thankful once I reached Devil's Lake State Park because it was a break from all of the driving. I took my note book out of my bag &amp; wrote down everything that happened so far today. After that I took my hiking shoes &amp; when on differen hiking trails all day. Like the Balanced Rock Trail, Pewit's Nest Gorg &amp; the Baraboo Riverwalk.</strong> </h3>
