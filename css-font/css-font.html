<p id="firstpartofparagraph">There were multiple times where Daniel was committed to God completely and trusted in him over anything else, even himself. Some popular stories of Daniel show his commitment and trust. When he, Shadrack, Mishach, and Abendigo, were told it was the law to bow down to the golden statue, they stood up against it. They were committed to God, and they continued to worship him. When Nebechunezzer threw them into the fiery furnace, they had trusted God would deliver them, and he did.</p> 
<p id="passage">"So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."</p>

    <p id="reference">Isaiah 41:10-12 NIV 
<p id="secondpartofparagraph">Another popular story is Daniel and the lion's den. When Daniel was thrown into the den he still trusted God would keep him safe from danger. In our life, there are a lot of things we are committed to over God, such as sports, family, friends, school, and money. Nothing should be put above God, and we should follow Daniel’s example and be completely committed to God, trusting he will take care of us when we are in danger.</p>
